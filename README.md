Safe Malware-Simulator

Caution

This is a sandbox-contained malware behavior simulator. It mimics ransomware, worm, spyware, keylogging, and persistence behavior without touching the real system.
---
It
* Forces all activity into an isolated sandbox directory
* Generates realistic artifacts (fake encryption, fake registry writes, fake network beacons)
* Simulates malware profiles through controlled behavior modules
* Logs every action with structured timestamps for analysis

It provides clean behavioral simulation for blue-team testing.
